- Telemetry -
automatic collection, transmission, and analysis of data from a system or device to a remote location for monitoring, diagnostics, or performance analysis.

Automatic Reporting: Telemetry sends data without human intervention.
Remote Monitoring: The data goes to a central server, cloud platform, or dashboard.
Real-Time Insights: Engineers and developers can analyze system health, usage patterns, and errors in real time.

| Aspect                  | Example                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **System performance**  | CPU usage, memory, disk I/O       |
| **Application metrics** | User behavior, API response times |
| **Error reporting**     | Crash logs, exception traces      |
| **Security info**       | Intrusion attempts, auth failures |

Software development: Tools like Visual Studio or JetBrains may send anonymized usage stats to improve features.
Cloud monitoring: Services like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or Prometheus use telemetry to track resource health.
Game analytics: Games send telemetry to understand user engagement, bugs, and progression bottlenecks.
IoT devices: Devices like smart thermostats or industrial sensors report status via telemetry.
