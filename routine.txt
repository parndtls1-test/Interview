 Subroutine
A subroutine is a traditional function.
It runs from start to finish, optionally returns a value.
It cannot pause and resumeâ€”just runs once per call.

Coroutine
A coroutine is a special kind of function that can pause and resume.
Often used in asynchronous programming or generators.
Created using async def or def + yield.

# Async coroutine
async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "data"

# Generator coroutine
def simple_counter():
    yield 1
    yield 2
