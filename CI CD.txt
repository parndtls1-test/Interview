CI/CD stands for:
CI (Continuous Integration):
Automatically build and test code every time a developer commits.
CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):
Automatically deliver code to production (or staging) once it's tested and approved.

Together, they automate and streamline the software delivery lifecycle.

Basic CI/CD Pipeline Flow
Code Commit → Developer pushes code to a Git repo (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
Build → Compile code, resolve dependencies.
Test → Run unit/integration tests.
Package → Bundle into an artifact (e.g., Docker image, zip).
Deploy → Deploy to staging or production (automatically or with approval).
Monitor → Check logs, errors, health metrics.

| Stage          | Popular Tools                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **CI**         | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI      |
| **CD**         | AWS CodeDeploy, ArgoCD, Spinnaker, GitHub Actions |
| **Infra**      | Terraform, AWS CDK, Pulumi                        |
| **Containers** | Docker, Kubernetes, EKS                           |

Benefits
Faster, safer deployments
Fewer bugs in production
Immediate feedback for developers
Repeatable, version-controlled infrastructure and code releases

Canary Deployment - role out to small % of servers for a time period, if all good increase that %.
Blue Green Deployment - role out to green server has new code, if issues, immediately role back to Blue, old code.

YAML config example
# .github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml

name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run

Breakdown
Triggers on: Push or PR to main

Job 1 – build-test:
Checks out code
Sets up Python
Installs dependencies
Runs unit tests

Job 2 – deploy:
Runs after build-test
Deploys using AWS CDK (can be swapped with Terraform, etc.)
Uses GitHub Secrets for AWS credentials
