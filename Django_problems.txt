Django Problems

1. Ajax, to give us 10 questions and not change the url from question to question.
2. user logon system.
    forget password, reset emails, how to setup through AWS
3. If new subjects/questions how to add for all users
4. how to pick 10 lowest score questions from the database and randomize them
    also randomize the answers, there are no ABCD
5. what to do if there are less than 10 questions left to answer.	
6. frontend items, Change background color from month to month. flex buttons.
7. After questions are answered, redirect the user to the subject page, not home.
8. sql injection on score_up/score_down, 
    user can see the url with userid and score amount 
9. add crontabs to reset scores over certain periods of time.

Future:
- Divide python into 4 groups, easy to advanced.
- Add AI, connect to ChatGPT, prompt it to give you questions about subject
    (this can be a users worst subject) 	
    parse result (question/answers) into the system. then score.
- what other subjects can I add? programming languages. Go, java, etc...
- multiple choice answers.
- complete adding AWS Dev questions
- instead of resetting to subject score to 80, let user choose with slider or input.
- maybe update to react
