Charter Communications
- I am on the Python Design team, where we automate client orders via a pipeline, and we setup multiple FastAPI endpoints.

The APIs can:
- setup clients, locations, Circuit Ids
- setup products/services for the client and also design the circuit:
    service, switch/routers, shelf, card, port, channel, ip
- downgrades, upgrades, disconnects
this is all using CRUD calls to a database.

Day to Day
- Add new products/services
- Troubleshoot and fix code bugs.
- code reviews, documentation, code demonstration, test out the code and setup pytest for the pipeline gitlab run.
