tuple  immutable, ordered, iterable
list   mutable,   ordered, iterable, not hashable
dict   mutable,   ordered, iterable, not hashable
set    mutable,  unordered, iterable, unique, not hashable
string immutable, ordered, iterable


List of immutable types and hashable:
int, float, decimal, complex, bool, string, tuple, range, frozenset, bytes

List of mutable types NOT hashable:
list, dict, set, bytearray, user-defined classes

Hashable objects are commonly used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets,
where quick look-up times are desired. When an object is hashed, it produces a hash value,
which is used as the key to store or retrieve the object efficiently in data structures like dictionaries and sets.
