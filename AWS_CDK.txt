AWS CDK is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that lets you define cloud resources using familiar programming languages like
TypeScript, Python, Java, or C#, rather than JSON/YAML (like in CloudFormation).
Infrastructure as Code

Core Concepts
Term	    Description
App	      The entry point of your CDK application (e.g., cdk.App() in Python).
Stack	    A unit of deployment (similar to a CloudFormation stack).
Construct	A basic building block — represents one or more AWS resources.
L1/L2/L3  Constructs	Low-to-high abstraction constructs (L1 = raw, L3 = opinionated patterns).

| Command                          | Description                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `cdk init app --language python` | Initialize a new CDK app             |
| `cdk synth`                      | Synthesize to CloudFormation YAML    |
| `cdk diff`                       | Show differences from deployed stack |
| `cdk deploy`                     | Deploy the stack to AWS              |
| `cdk destroy`                    | Remove the deployed stack from AWS   |


from aws_cdk import (
    App, Stack,
    aws_s3 as s3,
)
from constructs import Construct

class MyStack(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope: Construct, id: str, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)

        # Define an S3 bucket
        s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket")

app = App()
MyStack(app, "MyFirstStack")
app.synth()


 Tips
CDK generates CloudFormation behind the scenes.
Use context variables and cdk.json to manage envs/settings.
CDK is modular – only include the AWS services you use.

Useful Libraries
aws-cdk-lib — main library for constructs.
constructs — base library for all constructs.
jsii — cross-language interoperability tool CDK is built on.

jsii (short for JavaScript interop interface) is a tool and runtime developed by AWS that allows TypeScript
libraries to be used in other programming languages like Python, Java, .NET (C#), and Go — without rewriting the code.

CONS
Slow updates - feature isn't readily available yet. and not supported right away.
No multi-cloud support
Steep Learning curve -
