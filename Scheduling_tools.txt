What Are Scheduling Tools?
Scheduling tools automate the execution of jobs, workflows, and tasks — such as data pipelines, batch scripts, ETL jobs, or system maintenance tasks.
They help with:
  Job orchestration
  Time- or event-based triggering
  Dependency management
  Failure handling & alerts
  Audit logging
