I haven’t worked directly with React professionally, but I have worked with javascript before. 

I’ve built my own Django website duderemcode and worked with a lot of APIs and component-based development. I understand concepts like props, state, and one-way data flow, which React is built on.

React is high on my list to learn next — I’ve already reviewed tutorials, and I’m confident I could become productive quickly.
