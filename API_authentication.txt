- How does authentication work in API integration?
     how you prove your identity to the API you're calling. It ensures only authorized clients can access protected resources. 

1. API Key
    client uses a unique key, sends it within the headers
2. Basic Auth
    username and password sent with base64 encoding
3. Bearer OAuth2 token
    client includes this token in header of requests
4. OAuth2 with refresh token
    use token in headers, if expired use a refresh token to get a new one
5. Session/Cookies - if using web apps
