RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

Framework that combines a retrieval system with a large language model (LLM)
to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

How RAG Works
  Retrieval: 
    The system first searches through a vast knowledge base (like your organizations internal documents, a company website, or a set of PDFs) to find the most relevant information related to a users query. This is done using a similarity search on vector embeddings.

Augmentation: 
  The retrieved information is then added to the users original prompt. This provides the LLM with a specific, factual context.

Generation: 
  The LLM receives the augmented prompt (the original query plus the retrieved context) and generates a response based on the provided information, rather than relying on its general training data.

This process helps to prevent the LLM from generating inaccurate or "hallucinated" information.
